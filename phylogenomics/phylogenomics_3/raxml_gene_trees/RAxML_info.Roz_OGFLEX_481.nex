IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Basme2finSC|CE48968_45709 and Bhet|Roz_OGFLEX_481__JNET01029301.1_30939_34331_1 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file Roz_OGFLEX_481.msa.trim.reduced
