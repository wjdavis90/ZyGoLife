IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Morel2|Morel1.estExt_fgenesh1_pm.C_250041 and Zsp|01125-RA are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file Roz_OGFLEX_506.msa.trim.reduced
