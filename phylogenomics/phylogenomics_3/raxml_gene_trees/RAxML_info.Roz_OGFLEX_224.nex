Alignment has 225 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 1.72%

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 100 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
